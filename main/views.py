    "profile": "My most recent role was at a startup called Glimma AI, where I was hired to develop a functional prototype to attract investors. Following a successful funding round, I was promoted to Lead Developer, where I established our tech stack and assembled a development team. Our product reached the beta testing phase; however, due to the competitive advancements in AI technology, particularly with the release of GPTs by OpenAI, our CEO decided to pivot the company's direction and cease further development on the project. Prior to this, I completed numerous freelance projects and worked as an online English teacher for Vietnamese professionals, as well as a substitute teacher and special needs assistant at Clonkeen College. My educational background includes a full-stack software development course with Code Institute and a Higher National Diploma in Music Production and Technology from DFEI. I am also continually working on personal projects with new technologies and languages. I have a passion for technology and the process of learning new skills and applying them in real-world situations. I am currently seeking a role within the tech industry where I can challenge myself, learn, and make meaningful contributions to exciting new projects.",
